# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a variety of breakdowns of reading and math scores for ~15 schools while excluding the potentially questionable scores of Thomas High School's 9th grade class.

### Results
A number of the summary dataframes generated were affected:
 - **District**: Because Thomas High School 9th graders were a relatively small percentage of the overall population, the district scores did not change much. Average math scores descreased slightly and all three passing percentages declined by 0.1 - 0.2 percentage points.

 - **School**: Outside of Thomas High School, the school summary was unaffected. THS saw its scores and passing percentages in math and reading decrease; however, that drop was less than a single percentage point.
